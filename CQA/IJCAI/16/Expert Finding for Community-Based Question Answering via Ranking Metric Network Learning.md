## Expert Finding for Community-Based Question Answering via Ranking Metric Network Learning ##

***
### Abstract ###

* **Motivation:**  In order to provide high-quality experts, many existing approaches learn the user model mainly from their past question-answering activities in CQA sites, which suffer from the sparsity problem of CQA data.

* **Viewpoint:** we consider the problem of expert finding from the viewpoint of learning ranking metric embedding.

* **Solution:** We propose a novel ranking metric network learning framework for expert finding by exploiting both users’ relative quality rank to given questions and their social relations.

***
### Introduction ###

* **Recent works:** Most of the existing works consider the expert finding problem as content-based expert recommendation task, which learns the user model from their past question-answering activities voted by the community through thumb-ups/downs, and then predicts users’ performance for answering the questions.
